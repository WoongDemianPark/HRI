The ReSpeaker USB 4 Mic Array is the successor of the ReSpeaker USB 6+1 Mic Array. It has better built-in audio processing algorithms than the 6+1 Mic Array, so it has better audio recording quality, although it only has 4 microphones.

## Features
+ 4 microphones
+ 12 RGB LEDs
+ USB
+ built-in AEC, VAD, DOA, Beamforming and NS
+ 16000 sample rate

## Usage
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is recommended to test audio recording.

## Device Firmware Update
The Microphone Array supports USB DFU. We have [a python script - dfu.py](https://github.com/WoongDemianPark/HRI/blob/main/MicArray/dfu.py) to do that.

```
pip install pyusb
python dfu.py --download new_firmware.bin       #  with sudo if usb permission error
```
